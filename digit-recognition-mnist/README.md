# Homework 3: Regression Task

## Description
This assignment applies regression models to predict a target variable using real-world data. It includes data preprocessing, feature selection, model training, and evaluation.

## Files
- `digit-recognition-mnist.ipynb`: Main notebook for this task.

## Setup
1. Download the dataset from Kaggle:  
   [Digit Recognizer](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/digit-recognizer/overview)
2. Place the `train.csv` file inside the `data/` folder (you may need to create this folder).

Final structure should look like:
```
digit-recognition-mnist/
│
├── digit-recognition-mnist.ipynb
└── data/
    └── train.csv 
```

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Libraries: pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn, etc.
