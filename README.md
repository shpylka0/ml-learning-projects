# Machine Learning Study Projects

This repository contains a collection of machine learning projects developed as part of my learning journey. Each folder includes a focused task, complete with code, results, and documentation.

The projects cover key ML topics such as regression, classification, decision trees, and multi-class modeling — all applied to real-world datasets.
